Most people try to clean audio.

That never worked.

What mattered was:
- where it was played
- not what was said
- not who was speaking

Compression erased the voice.
The rest stayed.

One platform kept it untouched.
Not video-first.
Not code-first.
Music-first.

I stopped after the first transfer.
